- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
I noticed that associations allow us to create more well designed programs, since we're able to create some level of "communication" between different methods, and catch possible pitfalls within the program. Overall, I believe the idea of "classes having a relationship with one another" (as quoted by Jordan's slides), allows us to write a program that follows a more linear and straightforward progression. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
For this assignment, I definitely feel that I struggled the most with the train class. As noted, I wasn't able to finish all parts of that class, as I became a bit bogged down in what the point of the constructor was, and why we needed to put "final" with engine (along with a broader lack of ability to conceptaulize how the train class works). My javadoc comments for the engine attribute, the constructor, and the getEngine accessor are therefore much more tied towards its surface level definition, as my understanding of what they're actually doing was something I struggled with. 

As mentioned above, I was having trouble conceptaulizing how one car method is able to create a bunch of cars, and how that is able to get stored in train. While I know this is partially the point of association (i.e- creating methods with relationships with one another, including multiple things to one thing), it was still a bit hard to understand fully on my end within the context of this assignment.

One thing that did work was understanding the terminology to a greater extent (i.e- knowing what to do when it says to "create an attribute" or "create an accessor"). I truly think that having a more simple version of this assignment (like assignment four) gave me a much stronger basis for completing this assignment. 

My advice for someone taking this course in the future would be to always go to TA hours when you can. I think they do an amazing job of helping me talk through problems, and providing support for things that I lack the appropriate understanding of.
